# CS4800-Team2
=== CS4800 – Team 2 – Fighting Game ===

Team Members: Diana Ledesma Razo, Enoc Escalera, Esperanza Mejia-Eugenio, Scott Forsmann, 
Manuel Fernandez,  Angela Edwards, and Omar Abushaban.

== Description == 

Team 2’s goal was to create a fighting game, playable by two players, in the same vein as popular fighting games 
like the worldwide franchise Street Fighter. The game would be one player vs the other player, with their 
characters displayed on a 2D field. The players will use attacks to decrease their opponent’s life bar while 
attempting to protect their own. The 2D field will show this health bar, the players, a background, and respond 
to user inputs in real time. The game features a single fighting move for each player. Overall, this two-player 
fighting game is a simple program, involving much of the game mechanics relevant to a 2D game such as game loops, 
player controls, gravity, animations, collision detection, and game states. 

Upon launching the game, the user is presented a menu screen with a play button, options button, and quit button. 
The options button returns the user to the menu. The quit button exits the game. The play button begins the game’s 
playing state, in which the two players fight until one runs out of health. One player begins on the left and the 
other on the right side of the screen. The left player’s controls are A, W, D for moving left, up, and down 
respectively, and C for attacking. The right player’s controls are the left, up, and down arrow keys for moving 
left, up, and down respectively, and the space bar for attacking.

== Known Bugs ==

•	Occasionally when launching the playing game state, users will not be able to move the players. Exiting 
	the game and relaunching might fix it.
•	When a user losses all health and the game ends, player animations continue in the background.
•	When a user falls into the crevice of the map, they are not able to jump back out.

== Setup Requirements ==

•	Download the zip file onto your desktop.
•	In Eclipse, under the File menu, choose Open Projects from File System or Archive and select the game folder.
•	Once open, run in Eclipse.
